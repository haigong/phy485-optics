During class last week, I had a different sign than you for the phase difference of the multiple reflection interference.  I couldn't see where that difference came from so I thought I'd work through things as you posed them in your notes.  However, but still can't reproduce your answer?  You had

\begin{equation*}
\Delta \text{phase} = k \sin\theta \Delta y - \frac{2 k L}{\cos\theta}.
\end{equation*}

In your figure you have

\begin{equation*}
\Delta y \sin \theta +
\frac{L}{\cos\theta}\cos(2 \theta)
=
\frac{L}{\cos\theta}
\end{equation*}

or
\begin{equation*}
\Delta y \sin \theta = \frac{L}{\cos\theta}\left( 1 - \cos(2 \theta) \right)
\end{equation*}

so that we have
\begin{dmath*}
\Delta \text{phase}
=
k
\left(
\frac{L}{\cos\theta}\left( 1 - \cos(2 \theta) \right)
- \frac{2 L}{\cos\theta}
\right)
=
\frac{k L}{\cos\theta}
\left(
1 - \cos(2 \theta)
- 2
\right)
=
-\frac{k L}{\cos\theta}
\left(
1 + \cos(2 \theta)
\right)
=
-2 k L \cos\theta
\end{dmath*}
